# ðŸš´ London Bike Rides â€“ Tableau Dashboard Project

This is a data analytics project where I explored bike rental trends in London using a dataset from Kaggle. 
I cleaned the data using Python and Jupyter Notebook, then visualized the insights through an interactive dashboard in Tableau.

**The goal was to go through a complete data workflowâ€”from raw data to a polished dashboardâ€”and showcase practical data storytelling skills.**
----------------------------
## ðŸ“Š Project Summary

**The dataset includes hourly bike rental data from 2015 to 2017, with weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. I wanted to understand when people rent bikes the most, and what external factors (like weather or day of the week) influence that behavior.**
-----------------------------
## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation

I used **Jupyter Notebook** and **Pandas** to clean and transform the data before bringing it into Tableau.

Key steps included:
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Converting datetime fields
- Handling missing values
- Creating new fields (like hour, weekday)
- Filtering irrelevant records

You can find all these steps in the `data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook.

## ðŸ“¸ Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard answers questions like:

- What are the peak rental hours?
- How do weather conditions affect rentals?
- Do weekends show different usage patterns?
- Whatâ€™s the relationship between temperature and ride volume?

It includes:
- Line charts with moving averages
- Heatmaps showing hourly rental patterns
- Trend comparisons across weekdays and weather conditions

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas)
- **Tableau Public**
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)
